                    <p>
                        Every shingle roof we do, is done using architectural roofing. No matter what kind of shingle your roof has now.  We offer a free upgrade to architectural shingles if you currently have 3-Tab shingles. This way your house not only looks the best, it has the best roof. <br /> <br />

                        Every roof we do comes with a 2-year, no-leak warranty. We stand behind every roof we install. <br /> <br />
                        
                        If your roof is leaking, and no one else has been able to fix it, give us a call. We find and  fix the impossible leaks.<br />

                <p>
                    Did you know that improper attic ventilation not only inflates your electric bill in the summer, it can also cut years off the life of your shingle roof? <br /> <br />

                    Here in North Texas the heat can build up in your attic, and not only increase the amount of electricity needed to cool your house, it also stresses your AC unit, and weakens your shingles. If you want to cut your over sized electric bill, extend the life of your AC unit, and keep your shingles from melting off the roof, give us a call. We’ll review your attic ventilation and give you an optimized solution to protect your home and family.<br />

                <p>
                    Owner and president, Jeffrey L Schild, has been installing commercial and residential roofs since 2007.  He worked for five years in the Washington DC/Northern VA/Maryland area installing many commercial roofs.  Jeff has experience installing all of the various kinds of roofs including standing seam metal roofs, green roofs, hot rubberized asphalt roofs, single ply membrane roofing (includes EPDM, TPO and PVC) and any kind of coping or flashing work.  In 2012, Jeff was the operations manager for a small roofing company in Jacksonville, Florida, that installed over 300 roofs in nine months.  He was responsible for managing three installation crews, ordering materials, scheduling inspections and customer satisfaction.  During his time as the operations manager, the roofing company had an A+ rating with the BBB.  As a degreed electrical engineer, Jeff makes sure all his installations are in full compliance with current International Residential Building Codes.  Most insurance companies miss many code upgrade items in their scopes to clients.  Through Jeff’s expertise in the building codes, clients receive the maximum amount due them for roof replacement claims. <br /><br />

                    Schild Roofing, Inc. has kept an A+ rating with the North Dallas Better Business Bureau since starting in 2012.
